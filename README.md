ImageApp
=======

**Developed by:[Prashanth Ramakrishnan](prashanth_r03@yahoo.co.in)**

**Features**
- Uses MVP pattern, dagger for dependency injection and RxJava2
- I decided to use Java, although kotlin would have been nice as well (may be I will create a branch and convert this to Kotlin), ask
 me why I decided to use Java in case I get selected ðŸ˜‰
- Fetches the image details via the specified API endpoint from Shutterstock and shows the image list in a recycler 
view
- The image is loaded within a Constraint layout, whose width and height is set dynamically to maintain the aspect ratio.
You can see this in the presenter (ImageDetailsPresenter) class
- Includes unit tests for the presenter and **instrumentation** tests for the app flow. Run the instrumentation test via the gradle command
or via the helper that Android studio provides. I have written the instrumentation for both failure and success cases.
- Set up key signing and provide your relevant signing configs if you need to run the app in release mode, I haven't done this.

Refer [here](https://gist.github.com/jemshit/767ab25a9670eb0083bafa65f8d786bb) for proguard rules.

**Note**
- Assumption is that you are connected to the internet to use this app, I preferred not to write boiler plate code to check
connectivity.
- The app when opened by default searches for query as **music** under the **Abstract** category.
- Provide your client ID and client secret from your Shutterstock developer account in the top level build.gradle
- As discussed on the email, I decided not to implement pagination (which could have been achieved using the new Android Jetpack libraries).
- The API has a set category for Images to be "Abstract", and any query for search runs on this category. You can change the category
in the top level build.gradle
- The maximum number of items per page is also defined in the Constants class, right now it is 30(which is the maximum per page from Shutterstock)
- Styling and animations are minimum, I used Android CardView to show the list screen, everything is pretty straight-forward
- I decided not to invest too much on fancying the UI, the image is loaded using Glide, an helper library
- There is no database in this application, data is shown as is from the API calls!
- Tested on Motorola G4 running Android 7.0, not tested on the Android Emulator (I believe it eats up precious RAM on my Mac). I'm a person 
who tests on a actual device!
- Developed on Android Studio version 3.5
- Some example query strings that you can search under the Category **Abstract** are 
    - music
    - art
    - health
    - work
- Please note to give some time in between searches, since it is a free Shutterstock account, if an immediate search is given the server returns
a 500 error (strange).
- All errors are shown as a Snackbar message.
